Hi there. I'm the principal author of Mjolnir. I've worked hard to make this app useful and easy to use. I've also released it with a liberal open source license, so that you can do with it as you please.

So, instead of charging for licenses, I'm asking for donations. If you find Mjolnir genuinely beneficial to your productivity, I encourage you to donate what you believe is fair.

Your donations will fund the time I'll be spending making Mjolnir even better, and will be used to compensate volunteers for the time and skills which they have generously contributed to the project.

Currently, donations can be made by PayPal or with a credit card.
