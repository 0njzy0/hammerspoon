**Current Status:**

Hydra has been taken down, because it's not quite ready yet, and was released prematurely.

Current efforts are focused on making Hydra more modularized, by extracting all its functionality into opt-in extensions.

Also, because of trademark issues, Hydra is being renamed to Mjolnir.

**Update:**

I really enjoy working on Mjolnir, and choosing to not work on it when I could is very difficult for me. Therefore, I am halting all development of Mjolnir for the next 9 days, until August 18, as a sacrifice in contribution to [the Novena being held in the Diocese of Tulsa](http://cnsnews.com/sites/default/files/documents/Bp%20Slattery%20Letter.pdf) and probably elsewhere, in the hopes of preventing [a scheduled Black Mass](http://oklahomacity.eventful.com/events/black-mass-oklahoma-/E0-001-070800137-7) (which apparently even has an actual consecrated Host).
