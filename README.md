**Update:**

I am halting all development of Mjolnir for the next 9 days (until August 18), as my contribution to [the Novena being held in the Diocese of Tulsa](http://cnsnews.com/sites/default/files/documents/Bp%20Slattery%20Letter.pdf) (and probably elsewhere) and in the hopes of preventing [a scheduled Black Mass](http://oklahomacity.eventful.com/events/black-mass-oklahoma-/E0-001-070800137-7) (which apparently even has an actual consecrated Host).
