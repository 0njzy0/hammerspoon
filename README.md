**Hydra** is quietly receding back into beta while we work out a lot of kinks. In the meantime, it will not be available for download. Thanks for your patience.

***

**Updates:**

1. Hydra has been renamed to Mjolnir (due to trademark infringement issues)
2. Almost all Hydra's modules are being extracted out into opt-in third-party extensions
3. A minimal GUI is being added to make Mjolnir more convenient to use
4. Mjolnir's API will be almost identical to what it was before
5. Your configs will mostly still work; but consult the changelogs when you upgrade
6. Extensions will be able to be updated at their own rate, independent of Mjolnir releases
