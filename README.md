**Current Status:**

Hydra has been taken down, because it's not quite ready yet, and was released prematurely.

Current efforts are focused on making Hydra more modularized, by extracting all its functionality into opt-in extensions.

Also, because of trademark issues, Hydra is being renamed to Mjolnir.

For more details, see my blog post [The history and current state of AppGrid, Zephyros, Phoenix, Hydra, Penknife, and Mjolnir](http://sdegutis.github.io/2014/08/11/the-history-and-current-state-of-appgrid-zephyros-phoenix-hydra-penknife-and-mjolnir/).
