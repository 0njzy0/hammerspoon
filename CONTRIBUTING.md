### Contributing to existing extensions

Extensions are independent of Mjolnir and have their own authors and
release timelines. Your best bet is to go to an extension's webpage
and try to contact the author about contributing. The webpage can be
found in the Extensions tab inside Mjolnir.

### Contributing new extensions

See https://github.com/mjolnir-io/ext for instructions.

### Contributing to Mjolnir.app

First check the Issues page to see if someone's already working on
your idea. (I'd hate to have anyone doing extra work!) Then file an
issue about it letting us know you'd like to work on something, and we
can discuss it there.
